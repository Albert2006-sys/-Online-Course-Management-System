The Online Course Management Dashboard is a comprehensive, production-ready web application built using Angular 17 and Angular Material, designed to manage online courses, students, and enrollments efficiently. The application follows modern Angular best practices, including standalone components, lazy loading, strict TypeScript configuration, and a clean, scalable architecture suitable for real-world enterprise applications.

The system provides full CRUD functionality for courses and students, along with a structured enrollment workflow that tracks student progress and performance. A powerful analytics dashboard offers visual insights using Chart.js, presenting enrollment trends, course performance, and category distribution through interactive charts. Both reactive forms and template-driven forms are implemented with proper validation to demonstrate form handling techniques in Angular.

The application uses JSON Server as a mock REST API to simulate backend interactions, enabling seamless development and testing without a live server. RxJS is extensively used for reactive data handling, state management, and API communication. Additional features include authentication and role-based authorization, HTTP interceptors for request handling and error management, custom pipes and directives for reusability, and performance optimizations such as lazy loading and OnPush change detection.
